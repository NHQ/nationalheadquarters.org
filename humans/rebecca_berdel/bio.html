BIO Rebecca Berdel is an LA-based Motionographer and Creative Director of POSTREQUISITE, a boutique motion design company. She was born and raised in North Vernon, Indiana, and moved to Chicago in 2006 to earn a BA in Film & Video Production from Columbia College. Her clients include Ogilvy + Mather, See3 Communications, Mindhearted, Event Architects, Big Frame, and Bloomgarten Films, Boeing, Motorola, United, and The Oprah Winfrey Network. Past projects include videos for Go Tell Mama!, Run, Blago, Run!, and Manifest Equality. For several years, Rebecca collaborated with Chicago street artist CRO on underground political campaign videos. Prior to her becoming a dedicated Motion Graphics designer, Rebecca trained as a documentary film editor - she especially enjoys designing animation, infographics, and typography for documentary storytelling, and is specifically interested in using her technical skills and digital trickery to contribute to narrative content. Rebecca is also an accomplished outdoorswoman and a graduate of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), where she learned to telemark ski, build a Quinzhee (it's like an Igloo), and tell time based on the position of the sun. When she's not tethered to her computer at her downtown LA office, Rebecca enjoys reading, camping with kids, and training in Muay Thai.</p>
